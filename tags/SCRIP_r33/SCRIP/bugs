----------------------------------------------------  --------  --------

Outstanding:

Need parallel implementation of SCRIP                 07/01/00
Latitude bins not very robust for sparse grids        10/27/98
Deal with extrapolation for bilinear, bicubic         12/02/98
Remove cyclic bndy assumptions from bilin, bicubic    12/02/98
Problem with coordinate transform when both grids 
  contain pole point as cell edge (note that in
  such a case, turning off the coordinate transform
  by setting thresholds >pi, <-pi may fix this)       12/03/98
Bug in test configuration when SH transformation on   12/03/98

Fixed in release 1.4:

Conversion from polar projection back to lat/lon
  space extremely sensitive near pole                 07/01/01  08/20/01
Bilinear/cubic fails when cells overlap longitude cut 08/13/01  08/20/01
Bilinear/cubic iteration converges to bad solution
  for skewed cells                                    08/21/01  08/21/01
Nearest-neighbor backup to bilinear/cubic fails       08/13/01  08/20/01
Added feature to use input areas for normalization    06/20/00  07/01/00
Added error checks on weights for conservative maps   06/20/00  07/01/00

Fixed in release 1.3:

Added new binning options to restrict searches        ...do not know...
Optimized code for resizing arrays                    .................

Fixed in release 1.2:

Changed namelist input for map type to character      05/31/99  06/04/99
Added new output option for CSM coupler               05/31/99  06/04/99
Added additional normalization options for conserv    05/31/99  06/04/99
Improper handling of grid pairs which share corners   01/29/99  02/04/99
Uninitialized variables and subscripts out of range   01/22/99  01/25/99

Fixed in release 1.1:

Conservative remap assumed num_maps = 2               12/16/98  12/17/98
Change units of grid quantities back to input units   12/04/98  12/17/98
Add option for unnormalized conservative weights      12/04/98  12/17/98
Update user's guide for recent changes                12/02/98  12/17/98
Add different test fields                             11/18/98  12/02/98
Add support for multiple remap test                   11/18/98  12/02/98
Add bicubic module                                    11/18/98  12/17/98

Fixed in release 1.02:

Problems setting up latitude bins for polar cells     10/22/98  10/27/98
Input latitudes out of range (due to machine pi/2)    10/27/98  10/27/98
Bad coordinate transformation in south pole           10/22/98  11/02/98
