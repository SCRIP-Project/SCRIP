      This directory contains some grid files in netCDF format
      for use in the SCRIP remapping package.

      In addition, there are several source codes for creating
      netCDF files for use in SCRIP:

      convertPOPT.f  - converts input grid files for the POP 
                       ocean model to SCRIP netCDF format

      convertgauss.f - creates a SCRIP netCDF grid file for
                       a Gaussian lat/lon grid that a global
                       spectral model would use

      convert_old.f  - converts old grid files from a previous
                       version of the SCRIP routines
